There are 300621 searches in the training set
There are 12059 unique search ids (users)
There are 8358 bookings
Each user only books 1 hotel if they book at all
  when grouping the data where booked_bool == 1,
  every srch_id is unique

69.30923% of users book a hotel
2.780245% searches lead to a hotel booking

site 5 has the highest number of users -> 63.24342%
site 5 also accounts for 64.022% of all bookings
site 5 only had 2% bookings

site 33 had 0 bookings

site_id 30 has the highest percentage of bookings -> .04
  But it only had 8 bookings

most properties are in 219
  but only 2.797% of properties in this country get booked

Country code doesn't play a large part in booking percentages
  standard deviation of the mean is 0.003

BOOKING RATE
  We want to see if the booking rate is affected by any of these properties
  Booking rate: # of bookings/# of searches
  The overal booking rate is 2.7%, but each property may have different booking rates
  If the booking rate for a certain property does not chance as that property changes, then this indicates that the property does not stronly impact whether or not a user will book a hotel.
  When building our model, we want to rely only on the properties that make a strong impact.  Adding other properties will just add noise.

  To determine whether or not a booking rate has a strong impact or not, I used to standard error of the mean test:
    std(x)/sqrt(length(x))
  The smaller the standard error of the mean, the more tightly packed the data is.
