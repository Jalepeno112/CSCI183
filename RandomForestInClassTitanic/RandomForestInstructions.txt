???	gbm model
???	grid search w/ interaction depth 1,.,4 (this is number of levels in tree)
???	number of trees 200 to 10000 by 200
???	shrinkage .1,.05,.01,.005,.001

4. Inspect model
Create accuracy plot as a function of parameters: simply type trellis.par.set(caretTheme()) then type plot(model) 

Check predictor importance: summary(model)

5. Submit
Make Kaggle Submission
